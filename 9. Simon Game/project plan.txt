Create a simon game - the game in which you need to memorize combination of buttons shown subsequently by the computer.

1. The game starts once we press a key on the keyboard
  - once the game starts, the level X is shown, starting from 1.
    - create a variable which holds the level of the game?
  - use while loop which ends when a wrong combination of buttons is pressed.
2. The button gets randomly selected and indicated by the computer
    - find out how to pick a random value from the pool in an array.
    - once the value gets picked, the computer has to show only that button
3. When the right button is pressed, the computer selects and indicates another button
  a) game level is augmented
  - how to hold the actual combination of buttons?
    - use an array containing classes which indicates their colors.
      - check if the class of the pressed buttons
      - using push() method to add another button to the array of game combination buttons
  - How to check for the right combination of buttons?
    - compare each input value by the user with each value of the game combination
4. When the wrong button gets pressed, the game over shows
  - if the user input values don't match with the game combination, then change background and show game over title
  - the game resets once we press any keyboard key
    - listen for any keys pressed on the whole window object
